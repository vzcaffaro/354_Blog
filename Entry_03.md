### Thoughts on Lecture
This week we introduced parsing, which gives the program a set of rules defining the order of operations. This gives the programmer the tools to set up the grammar for a program however we see fit. The most useful part of the lecture for understanding how parsing works was seeing the parse trees and how the machine interprets strings into arithmetic.

### Thoughts on Homework
The homework exercises solidified my understanding of the lecture. After the first meeting of this week, I was a little bit lost in how Exp, Exp1, and Exp2 all relate to each other and how parse trees are derived. The homework activities of drawing our own parse trees and considering both different forms of the same parse tree and how to define another operation in the grammar all forced me to think critically of the concept itself. While I did not gain a clear understanding of the concept from the homework itself, going into Thursday's review lecture with a better understanding allowed me to gain more from the lecture than if I had not attempted the homework.
